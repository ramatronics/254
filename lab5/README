To compile the thread implemenation of the producer consumer problem
    $ make thread

To compile the process implementaion of the producer consumer problem
    $ make process

In both cases a produce executable file gets created
to run:
    $ ./produce <n> <b> <p> <c>

n: the number of messages to be sent
b: the size of the buffer
p: the number of producers
c: the number of consumers

Files Required:

Thread:
    producer_consumer_thread.c

Process:
   prodcuer_consumer_process.c
   producer.c
   consumer.c




note: when compiling the thread implementation there will be warnings from casting the
void pointer to an int. These warnings dont seem to have any affects on the results of
the code
