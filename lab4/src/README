Lab 4

Sadman Khan
Ramie Raufdeen


To properly build this lab, simply run the 'make' command on the terminal
This should produce a executable file with the names 
  -> produce
  -> consume

If that fails, run the following commands in order

$ gcc -o produce producer.c -lrt
$ gcc -o consume consumer.c -ltr

To run the program

$ ./produce <N> <B>

where N is the number of messages that the producer should produce and 
B is the buffer size of the message queue
